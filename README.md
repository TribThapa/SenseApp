Briefly, findings from our research show:
1. Power in the human voice - We lean in and listen to those we know.
2. Know your the environment of your channel - Podcast environments help make content memorable.
3. Understand the order effect - Audio as a channel primes listeners to other media outlets like TV, Out-Of-Home, and Social Media.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The business implications during media planning are:
1. Integrate podcasts as an audio strategy in your media plans.
2. Embed the human element through voice to build connection with your consumer.
3. Amplify audio effectiveness by using a familiar & trustworthy voice (e.g., radio or podcast personality).â€‹ 
4. Adopting an omnichannel audio strategy can amplify overall campaign effectiveness.
5. Points 1-5 can help drive brand awareness, brand discovery, and brand attention.
